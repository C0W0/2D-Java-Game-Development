This is a java game project by a group of high school students.
This is the framework of our game. If you are part of the group please try to do as much as you can. I really can't do everything myself.

the following are important information for programming team members:

1.   NOTE: the frames it took to cycle through an animation once can be calculated with the following formula:

     tms/1000* FPS* fra
     
     tms: animation delay time between frames in millisecond;
         
     FPS: the frame per second constant of the game
     
     fra: the number of frames in one cycle of animation
     
     the information above can be used to set up a correct FrameTimeController object to control animation overriding
